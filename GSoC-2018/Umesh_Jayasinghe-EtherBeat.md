## Student Info
Umesh Prabushitha Jayasinghe, Undergraduate at the University of Colombo School of Computing.

### Project Abstract
EtherBeat is an Ethereum blockchain analyzer. It provides a set of functions which can be used to analyze blockchain blocks, transactions and other related data. Apart from basic blockchain access operations, Etherbeat provides the ability to custom query on the blockhain. For an example, you can get a list of transactions related to a ethereum account address. Nested queries are also supported. Example scenario would be, you can list only the transactions to a specific account by a given sender address.
