### Project Abstract
Bassa is an automated download queue for enterprises use. If a software can download all your files in the background without keeping it open then it's all the best. Bassa can be used best if the Bassa will be a server where people can put the download in the queue and after some time your download is done. `Bassa still doesn't provide an option to download the file from the server. This project will lead to making files downloadable from the Bassa server in a single click`. After this target I made myself to do all the below tasks

   1. Changed the front end with download feature and implemented grid view of downloaded files
   2. Implemented file sending mechanism with concurrency handling
   3. Written compression module to send compressed file to user end when they hit for download
   4. Implemented file sharing system where user select some files and back end generates a link which contains all the files in a single compressed file
   5. Refactored back end API declarations, means separated endpoint declaration and implementation and refactored some files for ease of understanding
