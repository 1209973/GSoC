### Project Abstract

CLocal Azure is an local emulator to test or mock the Azure Services without deploying into Azure Platform, and provide easiness for developer by reducing the cost. Our goal is to have all azure possible local services into one single project and provide easiness to run a whole azure project locally. Currently project supports azure functions, azure storage and azure cosmos db emulators to run locally.

### Work Summary

For the GSoC 2018, I 've initiate the project from the scratch and added support for three services to emulate locally. 

Services added,
- Azure Functions
- Azure Storage (Blob, Queue & Tables)
- Azure CosmosDB 

Along with the above implementations, I have added sample projects for each service in the project itself and added an article every week and created a video series for each service.

### What Covered

For the initial stage I have covered the following services. 

1. Azure Functions
2. Azure Storage
    - Blob
    - Queue
    - Table
3. Azure Cosmos DB

### What left

- Portential to add more services 
- Add additional commands for services 
- Functionality to up all services at once
