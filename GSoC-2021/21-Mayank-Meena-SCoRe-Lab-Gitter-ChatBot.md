### Project Abstract

Many open-source contributors face challenges to get started with the community's projects. This project aims to
make a Gitter chatbot for the organization's Gitter channel to help new contributors ﬁnd projects of their skills/
interests. GItter-ChatBot uses gitter-stream-api to listen to all the messages in the gitter channel of a community. It determines the use-cases based on the search techniques that are present in its memory (as python lists/dictonaries/arrays). Gitter RESTful-API integration allows it to communicate with the user.
