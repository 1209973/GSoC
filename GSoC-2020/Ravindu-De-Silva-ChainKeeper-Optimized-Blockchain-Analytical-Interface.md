### Project Abstract
ChainKeeper analytic is a bitcoin analysis project for identifying mixing transactions/wallets. Chain keeper analytics made to gather data from valuable sources and model them into a graph and run some graph-based machine learning analytics like Note2Vec, Path2Vec, etc.  The ultimate goal of the Chainkeeprt analytic is to build an unsupervised graph-based mixing network detecting analytic engine and deploy it with the SCoRe Lab Chain keeper project.
