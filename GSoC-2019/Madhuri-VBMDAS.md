### Project Abstract
The ultimate objective of this project is to develop an automated software system with a graphical user interface that can estimate the manufacturing cost and time based on machine drawings. Machine drawings are the standard procedure for providing precise details necessary for the engineering manufacturing processes of products. These machine drawings include dimensions, various symbols, and the 2-dimensional views, describing the geometry of the product.
